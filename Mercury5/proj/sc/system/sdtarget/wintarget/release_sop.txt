DwlWin Version Change
=====================
	If there's a must to use latest DwlWin with the updated Wintarget, e.g. the protocol is changed. The DwlWin
version number in the file header should be modified. For Wintarget, the version of DwlWin in the header is
determinated by the `DWLWIN_VER' makefile variable in version.mak. Note that the version must be the same as the
target code.  If the DwlWin version of wintarget is changed, version in target code must be changed too.
	The version of DwlWin in the header in target code is determinated by two files: XRG.INI and config.mak
For CUS file, the version is configurated by tools/XRG/XRG.INI. You can find two lines like:
		CUS_ARGS=-g 1 -dv 3.5.6.13 -wv 3.03
		WPB_ARGS=-dv 3.5.6.13 -wv 3.03
where -dv is used to set the DwlWin version.
	For other files, the version is configurated by the `DWLWIN_VER' makefile variable in tng/config.mak.
Make sure the version configuration in XRG.INI of target code, config.mak of target code, and version.mak are
the same.
